5/28 Introduction
5/28 Practice Activities

5/28 Part 1
Why Spring?

Spring in a Nutshell, Spring is sort of an alternative choice of JavaEE

What should we do?
JavaEE or Spring ?  -> BOTH!

/* 5/28 */

9. Spring Core Framework
Goal of Spring:
1. Lightweight development with Java POJOS(Plain old java object)

2. Dependency injection to promote loose coupling

3. Declaretive programming with Aspect-Oriented-Programming(AOP)

4. Minimize boilerplate(样板，引用) Java Code

Spring Core Container
1. Core Container
	- Factory for creating beans
	- Manage bean dependencies
2. Beans
3. Core
4. SpEL(Spring Expression Language)
5. Context

------

Spring Intrastructure
1. AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming)
	- Add functionality to objects declaratively
		- Logging Security transactions, etc...
2. Aspects
3. Instrumentation
4. Messaging

------

Spring Data Access Layer
1. JDBC
	- Collections of helper classes that help programmers accessing databse
	- Reduce source code by 50%

2. ORM(Object to Relational Mapping)
	- Integration with Hibernate and JPA
3. Transactions???
	- Makes heavy use of AOP behind the scenes
4. OXM
5. JMS(Java Message Service)
	- For sending async messages to a Message Broker
	- Spring Provides helper classes for JMS

------

Spring Web Layer
1. Servlet
2. WebSocket
3. Web
4. Portlet

------

Spring Test Layer
1. unit
2. Integration
3. Mock
	- Mock Objects and out-of-container Testing

Spring "Projects"
What are Spring "Projects"
Additional Spring Modules built on top of the core Spring Framework 

Only use what you need: 
	- Spring Cloud, Spring Data
	- Spring Batch, Spring Security
	- Spring for Android, Spring Web Flow
	- Spring Web Services, Spring LDAP

Spring Development Enviornment

Spring & Hibernate for Beginners
Inversion of Control(IoC)控制反转
Outsource to an object factory
- The approach of outsourceing the construction and management to objects

Primary functions
	-create and manage objects(inversion of Control)
	-Inject object's dependencies(Dependency Injection)

Configuring Spring Container
- XML configuration file(legacy, but most legacy apps still use this)
- Java Annotations(modern)
- Java Source Code(modern)

Spring Development Process
1. Configure your Spring Beans
2. Create a Spring Container
3. Retrieve Beans from Spring Container

What is Spring Beans:
A "Spring Bean" is simply a java object

Inject object's dependencies(Dependenct Injection)
There are many injection types with spring
The most common two types are:
	- Constructor Injection
	- Setter Injection

Injection values from a property file
